2008-06-03: more gjrand_chisquared() tweaks.

2008-05-26: testother/onsphere, insphere, poker,
	testunif/addsub, crlf, metachi, selfcor :
	fixed initialisation of counter arrays. The problem was that some
	arrays weren't explitly zeroed. Most systems probably zero them anyway,
	but i fixed it just in case.

2008-05-24: tweak to gjrand_chisquared(), faster, makes a different sequence.

2008-05-22: posted version 2.0.0.0 on SourceForge.

2008-05-19: C2FLAGS in compiler for more standard floating point.

2008-04-17: A few cleanups for C++.

2008-04-11: gjrand_inte_crank64() rewritten for compactness and a modest
	speed gain. All generators now make a different sequence with
	same seed as before.

2008-04-10: More tweaking gjrand_biased_coins().

2008-04-09: New gjrand_poisson() with asymptotic speed sqrt(n).

2008-04-08: New versions gjrand_coins() gjrand_biased_coins() . These
	have asymptotic speed sqrt(n).
     Removed inline from some rand48 stuff.

2008-03-29: removed old deprecated function gjrand_insphere2() .

2008-03-01: testcommon/binom.h : now uses common integration code.

2008-02-28: testcommon/chi2p.h : now uses common integration code.

2008-02-27: testcommon : working on a common numerical integration code.
	integrate.h is a candidate (Romberg).
	erfc.h rewritten to use it.
    deleted util/moment.c (corresponding test deleted last year).

2008-02-09: testother/testchi now prints P-values for each displayed
	chisquared value; this tests chi2p1().

2008-02-09: posted version 1.3.3.0 on SourceForge.

2008-02-03: Applying the chisquared to P-value in palladiumbell: pdb bigpdb
	hence pdb and bigpdb to version 4. (NB pdb never had a version 3.)
    Applying the chisquared to P-value in testfunif:
	angle bds chi diff10 diff3 extreme nda walk
    hence mcpf and pmcpf to version 6.

2008-02-02 : Applying the chisquared to P-value in testother:
	coins dv fakepoisson fv longdouble mb mod2 mod3 mod pi2
	poisson shuffle1 shuffle2 snakeeyes
     testother/pi2 tweaked for speed + 64 bit counters
     deleted testother/pi3
     minor tweak to gjrand_shuffle(). may be slightly faster.

2008-02-01 : Improved P-value calculation for nda and chixor8.

2008-01-31 : got a way to convert chisquared to P-value. Should be much
	more accurate than the existing normal approximations, especially
	for extreme chisquared scores. Now beginning to use this for
	calculating P-values for tests in testunif. Note that this means
	testunif version 4 will produce different P-values for most tests
	than version 3 did.
	Done chi16 metachi shuffle v256 rda partrda slicerda shiftrda sh5da
	zrda chixor8.
	testother/testchi : now prints a measure of skew.

2008-01-25 approx : new test testunif/zrda .

2008-01-12: testunif/metachi : adjusted variance of variance, based on
		new calculation in ../util/metachi .
		experimental new xmetachi test.
	testunif/zero : brought in the new version with 5th moment;
		deleted from division2.
	therefore mcp and pmcp to version 4.

2008-01-03: testfunif/diff10 : tweaked output formatting.

2008-01-03: posted version 1.3.2.0 on SourceForge.

2008-01-01: removed testunif/division2/chixor16 : too old, too slow, too weak.

2007-12-30: testfunif/diff10 : new test.

2007-12-17: split testfunif into subdirectories for easier cleanup.
	testfunif/diff3 : bugfix, now read vecs of 3 not 6.
	    therefore mcpf and pmcpf to version 5.

2007-12-13: posted version 1.3.1.0 on SourceForge.

2007-12-11: New test testfunif/diff3 .
	testfunif/shuffle removed.
	removed lc2 lfib3x from testfunif/straw .
	removed r4da from testunif/division2 .

2007-12-10: New faulty generator testfunif/straw/lcprime .

2007-12-07: New test testfunif/nda .
	testfunif/shuffle 10 no longer done in mcpf.

2007-12-03: New test testfunif/dim40 .
	testfunif/moment removed.
	mcpf to version 4.

2007-09-27: posted version 1.3.0.0 on SourceForge.

2007-09-25: testunif/zero: moved the version with 5th moment into division2
	so as not to have to update the mcp version. Will decide its fate
	in a later release.

2007-09-22: Changed the licence. In older versions, only GPL version 2.
	Starting at verion 1.3.0.0, either GPL version 2 or GPL version 3
	at your option. Because i own all the code, i can do this without
	consulting anyone. Reasoning: some people who want random numbers are
	going to start using GPL v3 now it's out and i'm happy for them to use
	gjrand. But other people may already be using gjrand under v2 and
	might be locked in somehow, so i allow that too. Downside: GPL v3 is
	huge! It's going to significantly increase the package size.

2007-09-13: removed these old deprecated functions:
	gjrand_randmod() gjrand_crankhandle() gjrand_crash() .
    Bugfix in gjrand_insphere_2(). This only applies if __GNUC__ is undefined
	(presumably means you aren't using GCC). The problem was in 3
	dimensions only. Also affected gjrand_insphere() gjrand_onsphere() .
	The bug was probably only present in version 1.2.0.0 ?

2007-07-01: *rand48() functions, bug fix. This will produce new sequences
	for some of the functions. Probably more repeatable.

2007-06-15: testunif/zero : added 5th moment tests. Possible small improvement.

2007-06-01: testunif/addsub : reduced memory use in transform.

2007-03-23: experimenting with Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions.

2007-03-05: posted version 1.2.0.0 on SourceForge.

(A CHANGELOG complete from the start is released as a seperate file on
SourceForge .)
