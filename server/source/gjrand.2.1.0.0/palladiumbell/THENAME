Palladium Bell is a set of tests for normally distributed random numbers.

The name is inspired by the following idea: somewhere in the Paris suburbs
would be situated the headquarters of the International Statistical Standards
Institute (or equivalent in French) and in a basement they would keep The
Standard Normal Curve. This would be a huge bell shaped hunk of palladium
alloy shaped to the most exacting standards, kept at constant temperature in
a non-oxidising atmosphere in a shock-mounted bullet proof glass case. We
would expect the world's leading statisticians to visit the Institute from
time to time with laser measuring equipment to perform very precise
measurements on The Standard Normal Curve.

(Note to the humourously challenged: the above is a joke. The standard normal
curve is best defined using pure mathematics and does not need any physical
object for a standard.)
