gjrand_normal now uses the Polar Box-Muller method. This is very popular.

Christopher Stewart Wallace's algorithm (the source also acknowledges
R.P. Brent and Dr Christine Rueb). Search for "Wallace" and "FastNorm3".
This is incredibly fast. It passes all the default mode palladiumbell tests.
Wallace says testing has revealed very small biases for the two fastest modes.
For the two slowest modes no biases were detected, and these are still very
competitive on speed with other algorithms. It's only obvious weakness is a
moderately large memory footprint (just over 32K long term plus 32K temporary).
If you need billions of normal deviates really fast, this is the way to go.

Marsaglia's Ziggurat algorithm. I've seen source code for this (in GSL).
I don't completely understand how it works yet. It may be slightly faster
than Polar Box-Muller. Comments in GSL suggest it may have some accuracy
problems, but some quick testing with bigpdb suggests these are not
immediately obvious for small data sets.
